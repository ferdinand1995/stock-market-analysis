## Installation

Use a virtual environment

Create a virtual environment in directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

After activation, you'll see (venv) at the start of your command prompt. Now you can safely install packages:
```bash
pip3 install streamlit
```
